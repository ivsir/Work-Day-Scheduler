# Work-Day-Scheduler
Module 5 Challenge
## Description
This application's primary usage is a daily planner in which a user can write and store information into an hour long time block.

The planner includes save buttons for each hour of a 9-5 work day. When a user clicks save, the value they entered into the textarea of the timeblock is saved to the local storage. When the user refreshes the page, the saved information is still visible on the timeblock in which they had entered the information.

If the time value in the time block has passed, the block turns gray. If the time value is the current time, the block turns red. If the time value is from the future, then the block is green.
